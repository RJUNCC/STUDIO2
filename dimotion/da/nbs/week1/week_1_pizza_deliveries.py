# Challenge Questions
# How many deliveries took more than 45 minutes?
# How many deliveries were made in less than 20 minutes?
# Identify orders where the customer phone number is missing. How many such instances are there? Also why is this a problem for the business?
# What is the most common payment method for orders that took more than 45 minutes to deliver?
# What is the average delivery fee for orders that took more than 30 minutes?
# How many orders took more than 45 minutes to deliver and also had a delivery fee of more than $5?
# Does the pizza size affect the delivery time? Calculate the average delivery time for each pizza size.
# Create your own question and answer it.
# Bonus:, Create a dashboard to showcase your insights to management
